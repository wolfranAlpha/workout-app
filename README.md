# workout-app
A workout application exercise.

## Goals

This is a fullstack development exercise built to test a potential candadite for a FS developer position.
The exercise is built as an application with a frontend and backend, and utilizing development best-practices.

For each candidate the exercise might look a little bit different - discuss with your supervisor the scope of this exercise and their expectations.

### Time-Frame

* Between one week and two weeks
  * One - Only FE or BE
  * Two - Both

### Communication

* I'm available for communication via watsapp during the evenings, and in office-hours.
